    \nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license\
    \ document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe GNU General Public\
    \ License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\n\
    \nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take\
    \ away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General\
    \ Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all\
    \ versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.\
    \ We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most\
    \ of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its\
    \ authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software,\
    \ we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed\
    \ to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software\
    \ (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\
    \ if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\
    \ free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your\
    \ rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you\
    \ to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you\
    \ distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to\
    \ respect the freedom of others.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such\
    \ a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the\
    \ same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive\
    \ or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know\
    \ their rights.\n\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two\
    \ steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\
    \ giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\nFor the\
    \ developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is\
    \ no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL\
    \ requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems\
    \ will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\n\nSome\
    \ devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions\
    \ of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally\
    \ incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software.\
    \ The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals\
    \ to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have\
    \ designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products.\
    \ If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend\
    \ this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to\
    \ protect the freedom of users.\n\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly\
    \ by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development\
    \ and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish\
    \ to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make\
    \ it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot\
    \ be used to render the program non-free.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions\
    \ for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\
    \n0. Definitions.\n\"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public\
    \ License.\n\n\"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other\
    \ kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n\"The Program\" refers to any\
    \ copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as\
    \ \"you\". \"Licensees\" and \"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\
    \nTo \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in\
    \ a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact\
    \ copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the earlier work\
    \ or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\nA \"covered work\" means either\
    \ the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\n\nTo \"propagate\" a\
    \ work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly\
    \ or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except\
    \ executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes\
    \ copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the\
    \ public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\nTo \"convey\" a work\
    \ means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive\
    \ copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer\
    \ of a copy, is not conveying.\n\nAn interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate\
    \ Legal Notices\" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently\
    \ visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells\
    \ the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties\
    \ are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how\
    \ to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands\
    \ or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\
    \n1. Source Code.\nThe \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of\
    \ the work for making modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source\
    \ form of a work.\nA \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is\
    \ an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case\
    \ of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely\
    \ used among developers working in that language.\n\nThe \"System Libraries\"\
    \ of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that\
    \ (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which\
    \ is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the\
    \ work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which\
    \ an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A \"Major\
    \ Component\", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window\
    \ system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable\
    \ work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter\
    \ used to run it.\n\nThe \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form\
    \ means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\
    \ work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control\
    \ those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries,\
    \ or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used\
    \ unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.\
    \ For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated\
    \ with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and\
    \ dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\
    \ such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms\
    \ and other parts of the work.\n\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything\
    \ that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\
    \ Source.\n\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same\
    \ work.\n\n2. Basic Permissions.\nAll rights granted under this License are granted\
    \ for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\
    \ conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission\
    \ to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered\
    \ by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered\
    \ work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent,\
    \ as provided by copyright law.\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works\
    \ that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise\
    \ remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\
    \ of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities\
    \ for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License\
    \ in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus\
    \ making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf,\
    \ under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any\
    \ copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n\
    Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions\
    \ stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\
    \n3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\nNo covered work\
    \ shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable\
    \ law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted\
    \ on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention\
    \ of such measures.\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power\
    \ to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\
    \ is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered\
    \ work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the\
    \ work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties'\
    \ legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n\n4. Conveying\
    \ Verbatim Copies.\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code\
    \ as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately\
    \ publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices\
    \ stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with\
    \ section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty;\
    \ and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\nYou\
    \ may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may\
    \ offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n5. Conveying Modified Source\
    \ Versions.\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications\
    \ to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of\
    \ section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\na) The work\
    \ must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant\
    \ date.\nb) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released\
    \ under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement\
    \ modifies the requirement in section 4 to \"keep intact all notices\".\nc) You\
    \ must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes\
    \ into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any\
    \ applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its\
    \ parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission\
    \ to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission\
    \ if you have separately received it.\nd) If the work has interactive user interfaces,\
    \ each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\
    \ interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not\
    \ make them do so.\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\
    \ works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which\
    \ are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume\
    \ of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the compilation\
    \ and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights\
    \ of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion\
    \ of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the\
    \ other parts of the aggregate.\n\n6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\nYou may convey\
    \ a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided\
    \ that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms\
    \ of this License, in one of these ways:\na) Convey the object code in, or embodied\
    \ in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied\
    \ by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used\
    \ for software interchange.\nb) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical\
    \ product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written\
    \ offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare\
    \ parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses\
    \ the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software\
    \ in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium\
    \ customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable\
    \ cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy\
    \ the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\nc) Convey individual\
    \ copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding\
    \ Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\
    \ only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection\
    \ 6b.\nd) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis\
    \ or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in\
    \ the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require\
    \ recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the\
    \ place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\
    \ may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports\
    \ equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to\
    \ the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of\
    \ what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that\
    \ it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\ne) Convey\
    \ the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers\
    \ where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered\
    \ to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\nA separable portion\
    \ of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source\
    \ as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\n\
    \nA \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any tangible\
    \ personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household\
    \ purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.\
    \ In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall\
    \ be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular\
    \ user, \"normally used\" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product,\
    \ regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular\
    \ user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product\
    \ is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial,\
    \ industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant\
    \ mode of use of the product.\n\n\"Installation Information\" for a User Product\
    \ means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required\
    \ to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product\
    \ from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice\
    \ to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no\
    \ case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\n\
    \nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically\
    \ for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction\
    \ in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred\
    \ to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction\
    \ is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must\
    \ be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not\
    \ apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified\
    \ object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in\
    \ ROM).\n\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include\
    \ a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for\
    \ a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User\
    \ Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may\
    \ be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the\
    \ operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication\
    \ across the network.\n\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information\
    \ provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented\
    \ (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and\
    \ must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n\
    \n7. Additional Terms.\n\"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the\
    \ terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\
    \ Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated\
    \ as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid\
    \ under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program,\
    \ that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program\
    \ remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\
    When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional\
    \ permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions\
    \ may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify\
    \ the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to\
    \ a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\
    \nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to\
    \ a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material)\
    \ supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\na) Disclaiming warranty\
    \ or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this\
    \ License; or\nb) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices\
    \ or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices\
    \ displayed by works containing it; or\nc) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the\
    \ origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material\
    \ be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\nd)\
    \ Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of\
    \ the material; or\ne) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of\
    \ some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\nf) Requiring indemnification\
    \ of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material\
    \ (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the\
    \ recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose\
    \ on those licensors and authors.\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are\
    \ considered \"further restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10. If the\
    \ Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that\
    \ it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction,\
    \ you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction\
    \ but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered\
    \ work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that\
    \ the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n\
    If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place,\
    \ in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply\
    \ to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\n\
    \nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of\
    \ a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements\
    \ apply either way.\n\n8. Termination.\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered\
    \ work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\
    \ to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights\
    \ under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph\
    \ of section 11).\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\
    \ license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,\
    \ unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your\
    \ license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of\
    \ the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\
    \nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently\
    \ if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means,\
    \ this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License\
    \ (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior\
    \ to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n\nTermination of your rights under\
    \ this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies\
    \ or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and\
    \ not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the\
    \ same material under section 10.\n\n9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\
    You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy\
    \ of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as\
    \ a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise\
    \ does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants\
    \ you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe\
    \ copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating\
    \ a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n10.\
    \ Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\nEach time you convey a covered\
    \ work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors,\
    \ to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not\
    \ responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\nAn\
    \ \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an organization,\
    \ or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging\
    \ organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction,\
    \ each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives\
    \ whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\
    \ give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding\
    \ Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has\
    \ it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\nYou may not impose any further\
    \ restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License.\
    \ For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for\
    \ exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\
    \ (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent\
    \ claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing\
    \ the Program or any portion of it.\n\n11. Patents.\nA \"contributor\" is a copyright\
    \ holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which\
    \ the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"\
    contributor version\".\nA contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent\
    \ claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter\
    \ acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License,\
    \ of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims\
    \ that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the\
    \ contributor version. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the\
    \ right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements\
    \ of this License.\n\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,\
    \ royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims,\
    \ to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate\
    \ the contents of its contributor version.\n\nIn the following three paragraphs,\
    \ a \"patent license\" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated,\
    \ not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent\
    \ or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent\
    \ license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce\
    \ a patent against the party.\n\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying\
    \ on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available\
    \ for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through\
    \ a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then\
    \ you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2)\
    \ arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular\
    \ work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License,\
    \ to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\"\
    \ means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying\
    \ the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in\
    \ a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that\
    \ you have reason to believe are valid.\n\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with\
    \ a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance\
    \ of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving\
    \ the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific\
    \ copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically\
    \ extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n\nA patent\
    \ license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the scope of its\
    \ coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of\
    \ one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License.\
    \ You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with\
    \ a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which\
    \ you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of\
    \ conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties\
    \ who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license\
    \ (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies\
    \ made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific\
    \ products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into\
    \ that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\
    \nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied\
    \ license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to\
    \ you under applicable patent law.\n\n12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\nIf\
    \ conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)\
    \ that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from\
    \ the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to\
    \ satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\
    \ obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example,\
    \ if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying\
    \ from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both\
    \ those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the\
    \ Program.\n13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\nNotwithstanding\
    \ any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine\
    \ any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General\
    \ Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.\
    \ The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered\
    \ work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\
    \ section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination\
    \ as such.\n14. Revised Versions of this License.\nThe Free Software Foundation\
    \ may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from\
    \ time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\
    \ but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version\
    \ is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain\
    \ numbered version of the GNU General Public License \"or any later version\"\
    \ applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either\
    \ of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software\
    \ Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General\
    \ Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\
    \ Foundation.\n\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\
    \ versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public\
    \ statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that\
    \ version for the Program.\n\nLater license versions may give you additional or\
    \ different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\
    \ author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\
    \n15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT\
    \ PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\
    \ HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\
    \ OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\
    \ IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\
    \ THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.\
    \ SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\
    \ REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n16. Limitation of Liability.\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED\
    \ BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY\
    \ OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE\
    \ TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL\
    \ DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT\
    \ NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED\
    \ BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\
    \ PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY\
    \ OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\nIf the disclaimer\
    \ of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local\
    \ legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law\
    \ that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in\

- extractedText: " GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\nVersion 3, 29 June 2007\n\nCopyright\
    \ \xA9 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>\n\nEveryone is permitted\
    \ to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing\
    \ it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe GNU General Public License is a free,\
    \ copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\n\nThe licenses for\
    \ most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom\
    \ to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is\
    \ intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to\
    \ make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software\
    \ Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it\
    \ applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply\
    \ it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring\
    \ to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure\
    \ that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\
    \ for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want\
    \ it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs,\
    \ and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need\
    \ to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the\
    \ rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies\
    \ of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom\
    \ of others.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\
    \ gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that\
    \ you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\
    \ code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nDevelopers\
    \ that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright\
    \ on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission\
    \ to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\nFor the developers' and authors' protection,\
    \ the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For\
    \ both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked\
    \ as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors\
    \ of previous versions.\n\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install\
    \ or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\
    \ can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users'\
    \ freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs\
    \ in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it\
    \ is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to\
    \ prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially\
    \ in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in\
    \ future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\nFinally,\
    \ every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not\
    \ allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose\
    \ computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents\
    \ applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent\
    \ this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\
    \nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\
    \ follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   0. Definitions.\n\n   \"This License\"\
    \ refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n   \"Copyright\" also\
    \ means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor\
    \ masks.\n\n   \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under\
    \ this License. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and \"recipients\"\
    \ may be individuals or organizations.\n\n   To \"modify\" a work means to copy\
    \ from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission,\
    \ other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified\
    \ version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n \
    \  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the\
    \ Program.\n\n   To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\
    \ permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under\
    \ applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private\
    \ copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification),\
    \ making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\
    \n   To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties\
    \ to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network,\
    \ with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n   An interactive user interface\
    \ displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to the extent that it includes a convenient\
    \ and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice,\
    \ and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\
    \ extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under\
    \ this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents\
    \ a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the\
    \ list meets this criterion.\n\n   1. Source Code.\n\n   The \"source code\" for\
    \ a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.\
    \ \"Object code\" means any non-source form of a work.\n\n   A \"Standard Interface\"\
    \ means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized\
    \ standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming\
    \ language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\n\
    \n   The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other than\
    \ the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a\
    \ Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves\
    \ only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a\
    \ Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in\
    \ source code form. A \"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential\
    \ component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\
    \ (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the\
    \ work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n   The \"Corresponding\
    \ Source\" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to\
    \ generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify\
    \ the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not\
    \ include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available\
    \ free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which\
    \ are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface\
    \ definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code\
    \ for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically\
    \ designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow\
    \ between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n   The Corresponding\
    \ Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from\
    \ other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n\n   The Corresponding Source for\
    \ a work in source code form is that same work.\n\n   2. Basic Permissions.\n\n\
    \   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright\
    \ on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.\
    \ This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified\
    \ Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only\
    \ if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges\
    \ your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\
    \n   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without\
    \ conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey\
    \ covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications\
    \ exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works,\
    \ provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material\
    \ for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered\
    \ works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and\
    \ control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted\
    \ material outside their relationship with you.\n\n   Conveying under any other\
    \ circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing\
    \ is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\n   3. Protecting Users'\
    \ Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n   No covered work shall be deemed\
    \ part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling\
    \ obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December\
    \ 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\n\
    \n   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention\
    \ of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising\
    \ rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim\
    \ any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing,\
    \ against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention\
    \ of technological measures.\n\n   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n   You may\
    \ convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any\
    \ medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy\
    \ an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License\
    \ and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\
    \ keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients\
    \ a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n   You may charge any price\
    \ or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty\
    \ protection for a fee.\n\n   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n   You\
    \ may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from\
    \ the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided\
    \ that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n      a) The work must carry\
    \ prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.\n\
    \n      b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under\
    \ this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies\
    \ the requirement in section 4 to \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n      c) You\
    \ must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes\
    \ into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any\
    \ applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its\
    \ parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission\
    \ to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission\
    \ if you have separately received it.\n\n      d) If the work has interactive\
    \ user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the\
    \ Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices,\
    \ your work need not make them do so.\n\n   A compilation of a covered work with\
    \ other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions\
    \ of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger\
    \ program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\
    \ \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to\
    \ limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the\
    \ individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not\
    \ cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\n   6. Conveying\
    \ Non-Source Forms.\n\n   You may convey a covered work in object code form under\
    \ the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable\
    \ Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n\
    \n      a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including\
    \ a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed\
    \ on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n\
    \      b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including\
    \ a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at\
    \ least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer\
    \ support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code\
    \ either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product\
    \ that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used\
    \ for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically\
    \ performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding\
    \ Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n      c) Convey individual copies\
    \ of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding\
    \ Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\
    \ only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection\
    \ 6b.\n\n      d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\
    \ place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding\
    \ Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need\
    \ not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object\
    \ code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding\
    \ Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that\
    \ supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions\
    \ next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless\
    \ of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure\
    \ that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n\
    \      e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you\
    \ inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work\
    \ are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n\n\
    \   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from\
    \ the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying\
    \ the object code work.\n\n   A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\"\
    , which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,\
    \ family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\
    \ into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful\
    \ cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received\
    \ by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a typical or common use of\
    \ that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of\
    \ the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected\
    \ to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the\
    \ product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless\
    \ such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n   \"\
    Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization\
    \ keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions\
    \ of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding\
    \ Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning\
    \ of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely\
    \ because modification has been made.\n\n   If you convey an object code work\
    \ under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product,\
    \ and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession\
    \ and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or\
    \ for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding\
    \ Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.\
    \ But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains\
    \ the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example,\
    \ the work has been installed in ROM).\n\n   The requirement to provide Installation\
    \ Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service,\
    \ warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient,\
    \ or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to\
    \ a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely\
    \ affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for\
    \ communication across the network.\n\n   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation\
    \ Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is\
    \ publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source\
    \ code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading\
    \ or copying.\n\n   7. Additional Terms.\n\n   \"Additional permissions\" are\
    \ terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one\
    \ or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the\
    \ entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License,\
    \ to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions\
    \ apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those\
    \ permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without\
    \ regard to the additional permissions.\n\n   When you convey a copy of a covered\
    \ work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy,\
    \ or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their\
    \ own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional\
    \ permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have\
    \ or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n   Notwithstanding any other\
    \ provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if\
    \ authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of\
    \ this License with terms:\n\n      a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability\
    \ differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n   \
    \   b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author\
    \ attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed\
    \ by works containing it; or\n\n      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the\
    \ origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material\
    \ be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n\
    \      d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors\
    \ of the material; or\n\n      e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law\
    \ for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n      f) Requiring\
    \ indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys\
    \ the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability\
    \ to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly\
    \ impose on those licensors and authors.\n\n   All other non-permissive additional\
    \ terms are considered \"further restrictions\" within the meaning of section\
    \ 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice\
    \ stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further\
    \ restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further\
    \ restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may\
    \ add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document,\
    \ provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\
    \n   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must\
    \ place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that\
    \ apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\n\
    \n   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form\
    \ of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements\
    \ apply either way.\n\n   8. Termination.\n\n   You may not propagate or modify\
    \ a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt\
    \ otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate\
    \ your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under\
    \ the third paragraph of section 11).\n\n   However, if you cease all violation\
    \ of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated\
    \ (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally\
    \ terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails\
    \ to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after\
    \ the cessation.\n\n   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder\
    \ is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation\
    \ by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of\
    \ violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you\
    \ cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n\n  \
    \ Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses\
    \ of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If\
    \ your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not\
    \ qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n\n\
    \   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n   You are not required to\
    \ accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary\
    \ propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer\
    \ transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,\
    \ nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify\
    \ any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this\
    \ License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate\
    \ your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream\
    \ Recipients.\n\n   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\
    \ receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate\
    \ that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance\
    \ by third parties with this License.\n\n   An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction\
    \ transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one,\
    \ or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of\
    \ a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction\
    \ who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work\
    \ the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph,\
    \ plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the\
    \ predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable\
    \ efforts.\n\n   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of\
    \ the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not\
    \ impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted\
    \ under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim\
    \ or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by\
    \ making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion\
    \ of it.\n\n   11. Patents.\n\n   A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who\
    \ authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program\
    \ is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\"\
    .\n\n   A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims owned\
    \ or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired,\
    \ that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making,\
    \ using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would\
    \ be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor\
    \ version. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to\
    \ grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this\
    \ License.\n\n   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\
    \ patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use,\
    \ sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents\
    \ of its contributor version.\n\n   In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent\
    \ license\" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to\
    \ enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant\
    \ not to sue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\
    \ party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent\
    \ against the party.\n\n   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on\
    \ a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available\
    \ for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through\
    \ a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then\
    \ you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2)\
    \ arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular\
    \ work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License,\
    \ to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\"\
    \ means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying\
    \ the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in\
    \ a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that\
    \ you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n   If, pursuant to or in connection\
    \ with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring\
    \ conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\
    \ receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey\
    \ a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically\
    \ extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n\n  \
    \ A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the scope\
    \ of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise\
    \ of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License.\
    \ You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with\
    \ a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which\
    \ you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of\
    \ conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties\
    \ who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license\
    \ (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies\
    \ made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific\
    \ products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into\
    \ that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\
    \n   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied\
    \ license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to\
    \ you under applicable patent law.\n\n   12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\
    \n   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)\
    \ that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from\
    \ the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to\
    \ satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\
    \ obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example,\
    \ if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying\
    \ from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both\
    \ those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the\
    \ Program.\n\n   13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n   Notwithstanding\
    \ any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine\
    \ any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General\
    \ Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.\
    \ The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered\
    \ work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\
    \ section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination\
    \ as such.\n\n   14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n   The Free Software\
    \ Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public\
    \ License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the\
    \ present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\
    \n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies\
    \ that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License \"or any later\
    \ version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions\
    \ either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free\
    \ Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the\
    \ GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the\
    \ Free Software Foundation.\n\n   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide\
    \ which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\
    \ public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose\
    \ that version for the Program.\n\n   Later license versions may give you additional\
    \ or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on\
    \ any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later\
    \ version.\n\n   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE\
    \ PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED\
    \ IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"\
    AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\
    \ BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\
    \ A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\
    \ PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST\
    \ OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n   16. Limitation of Liability.\n\
    \n   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL\
    \ ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM\
    \ AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,\
    \ INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE\
    \ THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED\
    \ INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM\
    \ TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS\
    \ BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n   17. Interpretation of\
    \ Sections 15 and 16.\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability\
    \ provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\
    \ reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute\
    \ waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty\
    \ or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a\
    \ fee.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New\
    \ Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\
    \ possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free\
    \ software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo\
    \ do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them\
    \ to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of\
    \ warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer\
    \ to where the full notice is found.\n\n<one line to give the program's name and\
    \ a brief idea of what it does.>\n\nCopyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n\n\
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under\
    \ the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software\
    \ Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\
    \nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT\
    \ ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS\
    \ FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.\n\
    \nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with\
    \ this program. If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information\
    \ on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program does terminal\
    \ interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive\
    \ mode:\n\n<program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n\nThis program comes\
    \ with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n\nThis is free software,\
    \ and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show\
    \ c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show\
    \ the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's\
    \ commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\"\
    .\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\
    \ if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. For\
    \ more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\
    \nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\
    \ proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider\
    \ it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library.\
    \ If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead\
    \ of this License. But first, please read <https://www.gnu.org/ licenses /why-not-lgpl.html>.\n\

    \ \"Adaptation\" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other\
    \ pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement\
    \ of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or\
    \ performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which\
    \ the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably\
    \ derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection\
    \ will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the\
    \ avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram,\
    \ the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (\"synching\"\
    ) will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.\n\n     b.\
    \ \"Collection\" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias\
    \ and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or\
    \ subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason\
    \ of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual\
    \ creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form\
    \ along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent\
    \ works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A\
    \ work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as\
    \ defined above) for the purposes of this License.\n\n     c. \"Distribute\" means\
    \ to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation,\
    \ as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.\n\n     d. \"Licensor\"\
    \ means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work\
    \ under the terms of this License.\n\n     e. \"Original Author\" means, in the\
    \ case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or\
    \ entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified,\
    \ the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors,\
    \ singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim,\
    \ play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions\
    \ of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or\
    \ legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and,\
    \ (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.\n\
    \n     f. \"Work\" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms\
    \ of this License including without limitation any production in the literary,\
    \ scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression\
    \ including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture,\
    \ address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical\
    \ work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition\
    \ with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works\
    \ expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting,\
    \ architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which\
    \ are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work\
    \ of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work\
    \ relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a\
    \ broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected\
    \ as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer\
    \ to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.\n\n\
    \     g. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License\
    \ who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the\
    \ Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights\
    \ under this License despite a previous violation.\n\n     h. \"Publicly Perform\"\
    \ means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public\
    \ those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless\
    \ means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works\
    \ in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place\
    \ and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public\
    \ by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances\
    \ of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast\
    \ the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.\n\n     i. \"Reproduce\"\
    \ means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by\
    \ sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations\
    \ of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital\
    \ form or other electronic medium.\n\n2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this\
    \ License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright\
    \ or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection\
    \ with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.\n\
    \n3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor\
    \ hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the\
    \ duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the\
    \ Work as stated below:\n\n     a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work\
    \ into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the\
    \ Collections;\n\n     b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any\
    \ such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps\
    \ to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to\
    \ the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked \"The original\
    \ work was translated from English to Spanish,\" or a modification could indicate\
    \ \"The original work has been modified.\";\n\n     c. to Distribute and Publicly\
    \ Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,\n\n     d. to\
    \ Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\n\n     e. For the avoidance of\
    \ doubt:\n\n          i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions\
    \ in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory\
    \ licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right\
    \ to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under\
    \ this License;\n\n          ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those\
    \ jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory\
    \ or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive\
    \ right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted\
    \ under this License; and,\n\n          iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor\
    \ waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event\
    \ that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary\
    \ licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights\
    \ granted under this License.\n\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media\
    \ and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include\
    \ the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise\
    \ the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not\
    \ expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n\n4. Restrictions. The license\
    \ granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following\
    \ restrictions:\n\n     a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only\
    \ under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform\
    \ Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You\
    \ Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the\
    \ Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient\
    \ of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms\
    \ of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices\
    \ that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy\
    \ of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly\
    \ Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on\
    \ the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise\
    \ the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section\
    \ 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not\
    \ require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the\
    \ terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor\
    \ You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as\
    \ required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice\
    \ from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation\
    \ any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.\n\n     b. If You Distribute,\
    \ or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless\
    \ a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright\
    \ notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are\
    \ utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable)\
    \ if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another\
    \ party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for\
    \ attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms\
    \ of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties;\
    \ (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable,\
    \ the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless\
    \ such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for\
    \ the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation,\
    \ a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation\
    \ of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by\
    \ Original Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented\
    \ in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation\
    \ or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing\
    \ authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits\
    \ and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing\
    \ authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by\
    \ this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and,\
    \ by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly\
    \ assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original\
    \ Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your\
    \ use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the\
    \ Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\n\n     c. Except as otherwise\
    \ agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable\
    \ law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself\
    \ or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate,\
    \ modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be\
    \ prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that\
    \ in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted\
    \ in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed\
    \ to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial\
    \ to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not\
    \ assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the\
    \ applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under\
    \ Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\n\
    \n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED\
    \ TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS\
    \ OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR\
    \ OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,\
    \ FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT\
    \ OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR\
    \ NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES,\
    \ SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT\
    \ TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE\
    \ TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE\
    \ OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN\
    \ IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. Termination\n\
    \n     a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically\
    \ upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities\
    \ who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however,\
    \ will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities\
    \ remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8\
    \ will survive any termination of this License.\n\n     b. Subject to the above\
    \ terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration\
    \ of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor\
    \ reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop\
    \ distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election\
    \ will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been,\
    \ or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License\
    \ will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n\n\
    8. Miscellaneous\n\n     a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work\
    \ or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work\
    \ on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n\
    \n     b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor\
    \ offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and\
    \ conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n\n     c. If any\
    \ provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law,\
    \ it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms\
    \ of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement,\
    \ such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such\
    \ provision valid and enforceable.\n\n     d. No term or provision of this License\
    \ shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent\
    \ shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or\
    \ consent. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with\
    \ respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or\
    \ representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall\
    \ not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication\
    \ from You.\n\n     e. This License may not be modified without the mutual written\
    \ agreement of the Licensor and You.\n\n     f. The rights granted under, and\
    \ the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology\
    \ of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as\
    \ amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright\
    \ Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the\
    \ Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and\
    \ subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License\
    \ terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of\
    \ the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law.\
    \ If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes\
    \ additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are\
    \ deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict\
    \ the license of any rights under applicable law.\n\nCreative Commons Notice\n\
